1. a. the design mainly dependent on the weight of the things(main payload (eg. books)+ battery+OS, sensors, actuators, DC motors with encoders, etc),, keeping the weight and area in mind, we can make a deisgn to sustain the weight and have enough space, after that we place the OS, ROS, CAMERA, WHEELS and other required things

 b. that insta video of small toy car making: solving the problem of road gaps and ups and downs


2. what is non-holonomic car, STEAM programmes

4. check mail: for solar professor: if hyou have said: that you are no longer be working
5: recrrasta resume, with bullet points, and add ROS
6. contact jan for situation at uni projects and contact Mach for heloing with my project
7. differnece b/w ROS and arduniono
8. check the suspension working , and of the best car suspension insta vid
9. there are 2 things: robotics and german class missing due to trip: ask mom
